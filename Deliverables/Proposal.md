### Question/need:


### Data Description:


### Tools: 

* Python to ingest and aggregate raw data into a SQL database
* Pandas for exploratory data analysis and cleaning
* spaCy or NLTK for text processing 
* MatPlotLib and Seaborn to plot data for correlation analysis
* LDA, LSA, NMF for topic modeling
If time allows, Streamlit will be utilized to deploy the visualization results through a web app.
Python text processing libraries/tools (such as NLTK, spaCy, gensim, scikit-learn) are required for data handling.

### MVP Goal:
The minimum viable product (MVP) will cluster modeling of the preprocessed text data.
